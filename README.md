This is the Acme landing page. Powered by NextJS 13 and Hygraph.

## Getting Started

Intall dependencies:
`npm install`

Configure environment variable. Create an `.env.local` and the following variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYGRAPH_PERMANENTAUTH_TOKEN` from the Hygraph project.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
